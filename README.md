# LinearSearching
This is a program for searching an element in an array using the Linear Search method.
This method is one of the techniques which can be used for finding an element in an array. Although this method is inefficient, as it checks all the elements in the array from index position 0 to the last(even if there are large number of elements like around 500 or more), this method can be used for arrays containing small number of elements.
Another advantage of having to use this method is that your array need not be in an organized or sorted manner of any form like in an ascending or descending order which is necessary for the proper functioning of Binary Search and other methods.
In this technique, the for loop starts by checking the very first element of the array and compares it with the element that needs to be searched. If the condition is satisfied, it returns the value of the index position of the element in the array to the calling statement. Otherwise, i.e., if no element matches wih the element that needs to be searched, the initial value of variable 'index' is returned.
Then the value returned for 'index' are matched whether it has been altered from '-1' or not.
If it has been altered, it would mean that the element exists in the array and it's index position will be printed.
If it is same as it's initial value, then it would mean that the element does not exist in the array.
The comparing process in the for loop will continue as long as the value has not been found or till the last element of the array.
I hope you had fun while viewing my program!
I would soon post a method to Sort an array so that you can find what you are looking for in an array without having to use an inefficient method like this one.
Have a great day!
